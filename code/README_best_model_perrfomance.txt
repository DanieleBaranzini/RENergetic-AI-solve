NEW BEST MODEL for OSR USER_STORY_1:  

 

“model_s4” ... updating SOON! 

Best model at 5/11 is  

                     	model_s4	(Machine Learning: Least Angle Regression - LAR) 

Name in github:  

		     	“tbd” 

 

Target: 		MW (MegaWatt consumption) 

 

Feature Predictors: 	Series 

			Month 

			Day 

			m3/h (hot water)

Best model at 11/05 is  

			Model 003 (Statistical Forecasting: SARIMAX): 

Name in github:  

			RENergetic_BARANZINI_Model_003_Backtest performance_for_Model001 

 

Target:			MW (MegaWatt consumption) 

 

Feature Predictors: 	m3/h (hot water flow cycle) 

			External Temperature

Zone:			GDPR










07/05

:	Model 003 is the best model to predict MW values with the use of m3/h instant flow (hot water)
:	Model 003 is split in train-test set to perform backtesting and verify generalization performance and accuracy of the forecast model
:	to note that Model 004 has used outdoor temperature but with no success to improve the model performace with respect to Model 003 results

21/05
: Model 003a has a final plot showing the MW observed, predicted in training set and forcased in test set
